Is talking to Anthony Davis hazardous to your health?
In a manner of speaking, that's what numerous people with computers and modems 
apparently have been worrying about since late July.  That's when Oklahoma 
City police raided Davis' software publishing firm and confiscated his 
sophisticated commercial computer bulletin board system.  Authorities allege 
Davis was selling pornographic computerized materials on CD-ROM and through 
files downloaded over phone lines.
Names of everyone who signed onto Davis' bulletin board service, those who 
downloaded or uploaded graphic files depicting sexual acts and those who 
didn't are in the hands of investigators.
After the arrest, Earl Faubion, a police officer who runs a law enforcement 
oriented computer bulletin board system, got numerous inquiries from worried 
users.  "There are a lot of people concerned," Faubion said.  Many who used 
Davis' system for months and have been asking, "Am I in trouble?" Faubion, who 
ironically channeled much of his computer system's private mail through Davis' 
system before it was shut down, tells users that's out of his area of 
expertise.
